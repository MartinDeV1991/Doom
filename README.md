This is a classic doom game using the same game assets as the original game.
The player uses the W A S D keys to move around and the mouse to aim and shoot. The player moves on to the next level when all enemies are defeated.

The game is created using Pygame in Python. The playable version on itch.io is converted to a game that can be played in the browser using Pygbag. A downloadable .exe file can also be found on itch.io.
